# Java Lang
Hey guys!

This is a study repository, here you will find some examples of systems developed using JAVA language.
There are some directories like: "calculadora", that means a calculator sytem, "ping pong" that is a ping pong game, "quiz game" another game in Java and our famous "snake game", all of them developed in JAVA.


It's the basics of programming and the basics of gaming in Java.

See you!
